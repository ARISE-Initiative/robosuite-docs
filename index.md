**robosuite** is a simulation framework powered by the [MuJoCo](http://www.mujoco.org/) physics engine for robot learning. It also offers a suite of benchmark environments for reproducible research. The release or robosuite v1.2 features manipulation tasks with supports of procedural generation, advanced controllers, teleoperation, etc. This project is part of the broader <a href="https://github.com/ARISE-Initiative">Advancing Robot Intelligence through Simulated Environments (ARISE) Initiative</a>, with the aim of lowering the barriers of entry for cutting-edge research at the intersection of AI and Robotics.
